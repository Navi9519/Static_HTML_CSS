      <h1>ABBA MUSEUM</h1>
      <p>
        Plans for a dedicated to an ABBA exhibition in Stockholm, inspired by
        the Beatles museum in Liverpool, England, were first announced by
        founders Ulf Westman and Ewa Wigenheim-Westman in 2006. The exhibition
        was expected to open in 2008. Organizers estimated it would draw half a
        million visitors annually. The exhibition was to be located in the
        former main customs building in Stockholm harbor. After several years of
        financial issues the project was abandoned in 2009, and the building was
        instead set to hold a new contemporary photography exhibition, called
        Fotografiska. New plans for a permanent ABBA exhibition were announced
        on 3 October 2012. The exhibition in Stockholm, called "ABBA The
        Museum", is the permanent home for the traveling ABBAWORLD exhibit that
        toured Europe and Australia in 2009–2011, and houses stage costumes
        donated by the band members. There are also several interactive audio
        and video stations that allow visitors to perform the band's music. The
        exhibition is located in a building near the Gröna Lund theme park on
        the island of Djurgården.
